# Agillic SDK for iOS

The Agillic SDK enables you to utilize the Agillic platform from within your iOS App.
The SDK currently includes the following functionality:

 * Register devices used by a recipient in your mobile application.
 * Register a recipient token required to send a Push Notification to a device using Apple PN on iOS or Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android. When registered, this token will allow sending push notifications to recipients via the Agillic Dashboard.
 * Track recipient App Views. Tracking can be paused and resumed when requested by the user. Tracked events can be used to define [Target Groups](https://support.agillic.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360007001991-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Target-Groups) in the Agillic Dashboard which can be used to direct targeted marketing and other communication.

Other useful information:
* Read more about the Agillic Platform on the [official Agillic website](https://agillic.com).
* And in our [Developer portal](https://developers.agillic.com).
* The Agillic SDK for Android can be found here: [Agillic Android SDK](https://github.com/agillic/agillic-android-sdk/)

## Requirements

- Requires minimum iOS 11+

## Installation

See the subsections below for details about the different installation methods.
* [Swift Package Manager](README.md#swift-package-manager-(recommended))
* [Import Manually](README.md#import-manually)

### Swift Package Manager (recommended)

Add a package by selecting `File` → `Add Packages…` in Xcode’s menu bar.

Search for the Agillic iOS SDK using the repo's URL:
```console
https://github.com/agillic/agillic-ios-sdk.git
```

For detailed documentaion on setting up the Agillic SDK with Swift Package Manger see: 
[Swift Package Manager](docs/SwiftPackageManager.md)

### Import Manually
_NOTE: This is not the recommended method._ 

* Download this repository by selecting `Code` → `Download ZIP`.
* Open Downloads and locate ./src/AgillicSDK folder
* Drag and drop the AgillicSDK to your project
* Make sure to check `Copy items if needed` and Add to your App Target.
* The Agillic SDK are dependant on the Snowplow iOS Tracker SDK version 1.7.1 and FMDB (OUT OF SCOPE)

## Initializing the Agillic SDK

In order to use AgillicSDK you have to initialize and configure it first.

You can configure your Agillic instance in code:
* ``AGILLIC API KEY``
* ``AGILLIC API SECRET``
* ``AGILLIC SOLUTION ID``

See how to setup your Agillic Solution and obtain these values
in the [Agillic Solution Setup Guide](docs/AgillicSolutionSetup.md).

### Initialize in app

Start by importing the AgillicSDK Module into your `AppDelegate.swift` file
```swift
import AgillicSDK
```

Initialize and configure the Agillic SDK upon launch
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    Agillic.shared.configure(apiKey: "AGILLIC API KEY", apiSecret: "AGILLIC API SECRET", solutionId: "AGILLIC SOLUTION ID")
    return true
}
```

Your Agillic SDK instance is now ready for usage.

### Logging
Optionally you can enable logging for debug usage.
```swift
Agillic.shared.logger.logLevel = .verbose
```

## Usage

### Register App Installation

**Prerequisites**
* You need to make sure to do this AFTER `Agillic.shared.configure()`.
* You must do this upon every launch before doing any [App View Tracking](README.md#app-view-tracking). 
* Register has to be done in your Sign Up/Sign In flow but also on you splash screen if users are automatically logged in with an Access Token.
* ``RECIPIENT ID`` - Has to match `RECIPIENT.EMAIL` in the Agillic Recipient Table

###### Register App Installation
```swift
Agillic.shared.register(recipientId: "RECIPIENT ID")
```

### Register Push Token

**Prerequisites**
* Configure your app to be able to receive Push Notifications [Read this toturial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/11395893-push-notifications-tutorial-getting-started#)
* Read the [Agillic Push Notification Setup](docs/AgillicPushNotificationSetup.md) document to learn how to send Push Potifications to your iOS application directly from your Agillic Solution.

* Request permission for Remote Push Notifications in your App and obtain the Push Token from APNS
_NOTE: This requires you to have already obtained the Recipient ID and that you store this across app sessions - this is currently only supported for unknown recipients._

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) { granted, error in
        if let error = error {
            print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } else {
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
            }
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

###### Register App Installation
Read `deviceToken` and add it to your Agillic Recipient.
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    
    let pushToken = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02.2hhx", $0) }.joined()
    
    // Register with PushToken
    Agillic.shared.register(recipientId: "RECIPIENT ID", pushNotificationToken: pushToken)
}
```

### Track Push Opened 

_NOTE: Work in progress_

## Reading Push Notification sent from your Agillic

## Handling deeplinking from Agillic

_NOTE: Work in progress_

### App View Tracking

Track recipient behavior with App View Tracking.

App View Tracking is typically located in your `UIViewController` file, but can be used elsewhere if needed.

```swift
override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidAppear(animated)
    let appView = AgillicAppView(screenName: "app://sublevel-1/sublevel-2")
    Agillic.shared.tracker.track(appView)
}
```

The ``screenName`` is the value that can be matched in the Condition Editor.
We suggest to use a hierarchical naming convention, prefixed with `app://` ex:
* ``app://sublevel-1/sublevel-2/...``

*Examples of usage:*
* ``app://landingpage``
* ``app://landingpage/sign-up/step-2``
* ``app://dashboard``
* ``app://product-offers``
* ``app://product-offers/21``
* ``app://menu/profile/edit``

_TODO: Usage in combination with 'Deeplinking' and 'Dynamic Links'_
